        "# Plan for Student & Technician Profile Pages\n",
        "\n",
        "## Goals\n",
        "- Build actual UI for student and technician profile pages so users can view/edit their own data (except UserID & Role)\n",
        "- Provide backend endpoints to display and update profile data per role\n",
        "- Ensure routes are protected and role-specific\n",
        "\n",
        "## Steps\n",
        "1. **Create Controller**\n",
        "   - Add `UserProfileController` (or similar) with methods:\n",
        "     - `editStudent`, `updateStudent`\n",
        "     - `editTechnician`, `updateTechnician`\n",
        "   - Methods should load authenticated user, ensure role matches, and handle validation (name, email, student_id/phone, optional password).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Update Routes** (`routes/web.php`)\n",
        "   - Under `auth` middleware, add:\n",
        "     - `GET /student/profile` -> `editStudent`\n",
        "     - `PATCH /student/profile` -> `updateStudent`\n",
        "     - `GET /technician/profile` -> `editTechnician`\n",
        "     - `PATCH /technician/profile` -> `updateTechnician`\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Build Views**\n",
        "   - Update `stud_profile_view.blade.php` to show a form with read-only UserID & Role, editable name/email/student_id/phone, optional password, and Cancel/Update buttons.\n",
        "   - Update `tech_profile_view.blade.php` similarly (without student_id, but include phone/email fields) with Role/UserID read-only.\n",
        "   - Display validation errors and success message (if session flash exists).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Hook Forms to Controller**\n",
        "   - Set form actions to the new PATCH routes and include CSRF + method spoofing.\n",
        "   - Cancel button should return to dashboard or previous page.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **(Optional)** Add route links in navigation so students/technicians can reach their profile page.\n"
